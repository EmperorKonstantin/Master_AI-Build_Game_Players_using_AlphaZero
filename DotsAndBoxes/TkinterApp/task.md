### Visualization in Tkinter

As a final result, you should get the nice visualization of the game board and the players' moves in the Tkinter window.
It will work only if you are using the local version of the course on your own computer, 
not the remote one.

Most likely you need to [install Tkinter](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) on your system for everything to display.

So in this task, you will create a graphical user interface (GUI) 
for the Dots and Boxes game using the Tkinter library in Python. 

### Objectives
1. Understand how to create a Tkinter window and canvas.
2. Implement event handling for mouse clicks.
3. Draw lines and shapes on a Tkinter canvas.
4. Manage the game state and determine the winner.

### Task
1. In method 'make_edge(self, edge_type, logical_position)' add the code 
   to calculate coordinates of the edge, based on the logical position and type of the edge.
2. Implement logic of handling click event in method `click(self, event)`, based on 
   the analogical `click` method of the `FlaskApp` class.

Good luck and happy coding!
