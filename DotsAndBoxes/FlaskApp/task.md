### Implementing Web Interface

In this assignment, you will implement the `click` method for a Flask-based web interface 
of the Dots and Boxes game. The `click` method will handle the game logic when a player 
clicks on the game board in the web application.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Retrieve Click Coordinates**: 
   - Get the `x` and `y` coordinates from the POST request data.

2. **Convert Coordinates to Logical Position**:
   - Use the `convert_edge_to_logical_position` method to translate the click coordinates to the logical position on the game board.

3. **Update Board and Perform Action**:
   - If the edge is not occupied, update the board using `update_board` and `perform` methods.
   - Determine which player's turn it is and what color to use for the edge.

4. **Prepare and Return Response**:
   - Create the response data including the edge data, player data, and cell status.
   - Return the response as a JSON object.

Look carefully at the `templates/index.html` page to better understand how to implement the `click` method.
