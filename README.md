# AlphaZero course (JetBrains Academy version) [![official JetBrains project](http://jb.gg/badges/official.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)
In this course, you will build an AlphaZero-like artificial intelligence system from scratch.

[AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero), developed by DeepMind, represents a groundbreaking approach in the field of AI, 
capable of mastering complex games like Chess, Shogi, and Go 
through self-play and deep reinforcement learning. 

This project aims to introduce you to the core principles behind 
AlphaZero's architecture and learning processes by applying these concepts to 
simpler board games like [TicTacToe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) and [Dots and Boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_boxes).
