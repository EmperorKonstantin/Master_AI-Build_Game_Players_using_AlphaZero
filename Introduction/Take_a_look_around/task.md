**Welcome to our course!**

We invite you to join our course [Discord chat](https://jb.gg/academy/discord/masterAI)! It's a great space to ask questions, engage with our instructors, and connect with your fellow students.

The course is logically divided into lessons, where we will start by creating a simple board game and progress to training a model capable of playing complex board games.

### Trial course
#### TicTacToe
Create a game board and methods to play Tic-Tac-Toe. The result will be a game you can play with a friend.

#### MCTS
Implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. As a result, MCTS will serve as the second player in Tic-Tac-Toe. 

#### ResNetEstimator
Here, we will begin implementing the ResNet model for next-move prediction and position estimation, ensuring that it can interact with our game board.

### Full course 
#### AlphaMCTS
In this step, we will modify the implementation of the MCTS algorithm to incorporate the policy and value from the neural network.

#### AlphaZero
Here, we will finally implement methods to simulate a game where the AI plays against itself and train the neural network model using the data collected from self-play. 

#### ConnectFour
In this step, we will develop a Connect Four game board and explore how easily we can train an existing model for another game!

#### DotsAndBoxes
In this final lesson, we will implement the Dots and Boxes game and add a graphical interface. When combined with the model trained for this game, we will have a complete application that can play against you. Will you try to win?
