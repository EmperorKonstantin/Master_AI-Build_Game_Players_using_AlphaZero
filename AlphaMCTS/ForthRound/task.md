Here you see a short demo of the current version. A `Round` instance representing the TicTacToe game is created, 
and the MCTS algorithm is initialized with the game instance and a neural network model.

The game enters a loop where each player takes turns until the game concludes (`is_playing` becomes False). The current player (`player`) alternates between 1 (human player) and -1 (AI player).

Also we encourage you to look at the nice visualization of the tree-search building.You can find it at https://vgarciasc.github.io/mcts-viz/

Have fun playing!
