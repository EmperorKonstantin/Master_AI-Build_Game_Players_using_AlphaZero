The provided code outlines the process of playing a TicTacToe game up to a certain state 
and then using a pre-trained neural network model, specifically a ResNet model, to evaluate the current game state. 
This evaluation includes generating a policy (a probability distribution over possible next moves) 
and estimating the value of the current game state (how favorable it is to the current player). 

A bar chart is displayed, showing the probability of each possible move according to the model's policy. 
This visualization helps in understanding which moves 
the model considers to be the most promising given the current game state.
